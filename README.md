# Machine Learning with Graphs

Solutions to the assignments of the course __CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs__ offered by Stanford University. The Winter-2021 offering of this class was chosen, as the assignments had more content.

3 assignments have been worked on consisting of 3 Colab Notebooks, each aiming to teach a different topic. Specifically:

- Colab 1: Training a vanilla Neural Network to learn the node embeddings of the KarateClub dataset

- Colab 4: Some DeepSnap functionalities for Heterogeneous Graphs, and an implementations of Heterogeneous GNN Convolutional/Attention models for node property prediction on the ACM(3025) dataset.

- Colab 5: Neighbor Sampling
